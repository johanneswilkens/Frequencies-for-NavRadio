# Frequencies for NavRadio+
This repo contains a json file with frequency list(s) for the excellent NavRadio+ app.

The data in this file is from the table on this site: https://www.radiofreak.nl/frequenties/

The data has been converted to json format using the included python script.

Some radio stations use more than nine frequencies to cover the whole country, lists which contain more than nine frequencies somehow make the app crash when editing the station (but it does try to search for better frequencies), so you might need to manually modify those before loading the file onto your radio to cover the area you live.


# Disclaimer
I do only have the free version of the app, so no logos are included. 
This list is tested on a FYT UIS8581 radio. I cannot guarantee that it will work on other models. 
I am not responsible for any damage made when using this list on your radio.
The converter python script is mainly written by ChatGPT with some small adjustments.
